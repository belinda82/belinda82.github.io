      <h5>Yoga is a Sanskrit term that means joining or uniting Its an ancient physical and mental discipline originally developed in India, where it also incorporates Hindu philosophy. Outside of India, yoga is more commonly viewed as a form of exercise. Humans who practice yoga are either a yogi (male) or yogini (female). The canine equivalent is a dogi (male) or dogini (female). Like yoga, doga balances, harmonizes, purifies and transcends the body and mind of the practitioner, says doga teacher Madhavi Bhatia. What makes doga unique is the practice and benefits that create a harmony and synchronization of energy flow between the owner and dog. Though Im a restless sort who has avoided yoga for superficial reasons (who has time to sit still and think of nothing?), I was instantly attracted to doga. After all, isnt anything more fun and interesting when you can bring your dog? I signed up my 10-year-old Catahoula, Desoto, for doga class at Wiggles n Wags in Lombard, Ill. We were joined by my friend Barb Scalise and her six-year-old Vizsla, Penny. We each brought mats for ourselves and our dogs, treats and water. Neither of us had prior yoga experience.
